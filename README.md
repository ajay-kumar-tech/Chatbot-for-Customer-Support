# Chatbot-for-Customer-Support 🤖💬

This project develops a **Customer Support Chatbot** using a **Transformer-based Seq2Seq model** with **Encoder-Decoder architecture and Attention Mechanism**. Rather than building from scratch, the chatbot leverages **transfer learning** by fine-tuning a **pre-trained model** (such as GPT-2, BERT, or T5), enabling it to deliver accurate, context-aware, and human-like responses.
